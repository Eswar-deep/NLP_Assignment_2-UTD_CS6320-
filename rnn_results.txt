TEST 1: hidden_dim=32, epochs=5
================================================================================

CONFIGURATION:
- Hidden dimensions: 32
- Max epochs: 5
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.01)
- Word embeddings: 50 dimensions
- Batch size: 16

RESULTS:
Epoch 1:
  - Loss: 2.4374
  - Training Accuracy: 0.478875 (47.89%)
  - Validation Accuracy: 0.56125 (56.13%)
  
Epoch 2:
  - Loss: 1.1276
  - Training Accuracy: 0.50325 (50.33%)
  - Validation Accuracy: 0.515 (51.50%)
  - STOPPED EARLY: Overfitting detected (validation decreased while training increased)

SUMMARY:
- Best validation accuracy: 0.56125 (56.13%) at epoch 1
- Stopped at epoch 2 due to early stopping
- Training time: ~5 minutes total
- The model showed signs of overfitting after just 1 epoch

COMPARISON SUMMARY
================================================================================

Model                    Hidden Dim    Best Val Acc    Epochs Run    Status
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RNN Model 1                  32          56.13%           2/5      Stopped early
RNN Model 2                  64          46.38%           5/5      Completed

WINNER: RNN Model 1 (hidden_dim=32)
- Better validation accuracy (56.13% vs 46.38%)
- Faster training (stopped early at epoch 2)
- More stable loss progression

OBSERVATIONS:
1. Smaller hidden dimensions (32) performed better than larger ones (64)
2. The model with hidden_dim=32 showed early signs of overfitting
3. The 64-dimensional model had more unstable training
4. Both models achieved reasonable sentiment classification accuracy
5. Early stopping mechanism worked correctly in Model 1

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RUNS
================================================================================

1. Test with hidden_dim=16 or hidden_dim=24 for comparison
2. Consider reducing learning rate from 0.01 to 0.001 for stability
3. Try different optimization techniques (SGD with momentum)
4. Experiment with different embedding dimensions
5. Consider using LSTM or GRU instead of basic RNN
6. Add dropout regularization to reduce overfitting
7. Increase epochs for hidden_dim=32 to see full training curve

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Early stopping mechanism successfully prevented overfitting
- The RNN successfully processed sequences using word embeddings
- Model architecture: RNN -> Linear(5) -> Sum over time -> LogSoftmax
- Used Adam optimizer as recommended for RNN training
- Training was efficient, averaging ~4 it/s for training batches
- Validation was very fast, averaging ~170 it/s
